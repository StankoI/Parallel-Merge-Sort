This project implements Parallel Merge Sort with Client-Server Architecture for the course in Networking Programming. The client opens a connection with the server and passes the number of threads, array to be sorted, and the size of the array. The server divides the array into chunks, and each chunk is given to a thread of nearly equal size. Each thread sorts its chunk using Insertion Sort, and once all the threads are done sorting, then the server merges the sorted chunks into a single sorted array. Finally, the server returns the fully sorted array to the client. The system uses TCP/IP sockets for communication, multithreading for parallel processing, and effectively combines Insertion Sort for small chunks with Merge for final merging, demonstrating parallel processing in a distributed system.
